      My name is goose for all that a name matters. I enjoy making software, learning about arbitrary technology, and
      being opinionated about finding clean code solutions. Outside of that, I enjoy running, long walks, lifing heavy
      things, and spending time outside.

      This website is a current side project of mine with the end goal being to understand remind myself of the skills I
      want to know to be an effective developer on the web. For now, I'm following the guidance of <a
        href="https://htmlforpeople.com">HTML for People</a>. The walkthough seems a bit trivial for developers with a
      bit of experience, but as a method of looking at HTML (and CSS) without a framework, I think the resource is good.
